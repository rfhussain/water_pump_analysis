# Water Pump Analysis

This is a data science competition that has been hosted on https://www.drivendata.org/
The files are organiated the following way

### 1- [Data Analysis](water_pump_analysis.ipynb)

	- Analysis of the data
	- Inspection of different features
	- Identifying different patterns in the data	
	- Data Imputation, Cleansing, Organizing etc
	- Apply Dimensionality reduction
	- Generating different featuresets based on the analysis
	
	
	
### 2- [Feature Selection](feature_set_selection.ipynb)

	- Use the based Random Forest Model
	- Test the base model with all the feature sets created during analysis
	- Selection of the best Feature Set for the Model Optimization
	
	
### 3- [Model Selection-1](model_selection.ipynb)
### 4- [Model Selection-2](model_selection_1.ipynb)
### 5- [Model Selection-3](model_selection_2.ipynb)

	- Select the best feature set
	- Apply various optimiation techniques on the Model
	- Try to improve the accuracy
	- Dealing with the class imbalance
	

### 4- [Prediction & Submission](model_prediction.ipynb)	

	- Select the Best Optimized Model
	- Select the best Feature Set
	- Get the Prediction on the Test Set
	- Employ Weighted Classifiers for Submissions due to class Imbalance
	- Employ Averaging technique, by selecting the best classifiers
	- Generate the Submission File for submission on the Site
	- Saving the Score Logs
