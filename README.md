# Water Pump Analysis

This is a data science competition that has been hosted on https://www.drivendata.org/


I have organized my work the following way

### 1- Data Analysis

	- [Water Pump Analysis](a href=water_pump_analysis.ipynb)
	- Analysis of the data
	- Inspection of different features
	- Identifying different patterns in the data	
	- Data Imputation, Cleansing, Organizing etc
	- Apply Dimensionality reduction
	- Generating different featuresets based on the analysis
	
	
	
### 2- Feature Selection

	- [Feature Selection](a href=feature_set_selection.ipynb)
	- Use the based Random Forest Model
	- Test the base model with all the feature sets created during analysis
	- Selection of the best Feature Set for the Model Optimization
	
	
### 3- Model Selection

	- [Model Selection](a href=model_selection.ipynb)
	- Select the best feature set
	- Apply various optimiation techniques on the Model
	- Try to improve the accuracy


### 3- Prediction & Submission

	- [Submission & Prediction](model_prediction.ipynb)
	- Select the Best Optimized Model
	- Select the best Feature Set
	- Get the Prediction on the Test Set
	- Generate the Submission File for submission on the Site
	- Saving the Score Logs
